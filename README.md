# Installation

The following command installs dependencies for both the backend and frontend app at the same time:

```bash
npm install
```

# Running

Running the project is a two step process

1. `npm run bundler` bundles the frontend app
2. `npm run server` starts the server

# Testing

The tests depend on the frontend being bundled (ie. `npm run bundler`).
Test may be run using:

```bash
npm test
```
